<h2>What is Cymbal?</h2>
<p>Cymbal is a simple, intuitive programming language designed to output basic MIDI
in MIPS assembly language. It makes use of the MIDI syscall functionality of the
MIPS architecture. The Cymbal language and compiler were both written by Tyler Harley,
Harry Bartlett, and Terrence Tan in 2014 for the Compiler Construction course at Colby College.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Cymbal is a language which shies away from confusing symbolic syntax and grammar found
in other commonly used languages. It is built around the common nomenclature and notation
of music. Code is written in "quarter notes", "rests", and "octaves" rather than ints and floats
and arrays.<br/><br/>Users can simply write out what note they want played and for what duration, and
the corresponding MIDI sound will be produced.</p>

<pre>
<code>	// This produces an arpegiatted A Major chord
	Half A4
	Half C#4
	Half E4</code></pre>


<p>It's as simple as that. One note corresponds to one MIDI tone (note: due to limitations
on the MIDI functionality of MIPS, MIDI chords sadly cannot be produced). You can organize 
notes linearly or through a subroutine call structure. There are several different control 
structures that will be mentioned in detail later, and they all follow a basic <em>block</em>
form. Everything in Cymbal can be written in nested blocks. Whatever notes are written within
certain blocks will have certain attributes when they play according to the <strong>nearest
appropriate block.</strong> This means that notes (or <a href="#phrases">phrases</a>) played 
will possess all the attributes of blocks they are nested within. However, if a note is 
nested more than once within the same type of block, it will only be altered by the innermost 
of those blocks. Also note that indentation and whitespace is not important in Cymbal, nor are
semicolons!</p>

<pre>
<code>  
	// If Block A and Block B are of DIFFERENT types
	
	<em>Block A</em> {
		Quarter C3 // Will have properties of Block A
		Quarter F3 // Will have properties of Block A
		
		<em>Block B</em> {
			Quarter C4 // Will have properties of Blocks A and B
			Quarter F4 // Will have properties of Blocks A and B
		}
		
	}
	 
	// If Block A and Block B are of the SAME type

	<em>Block A</em> {
		Quarter C3 // Will have properties of Block A
		Quarter F3 // Will have properties of Block A
		
		<em>Block B</em> {
			Quarter C4 // Will have properties of Block B
			Quarter F4 // Will have properties of Block B
		}
		
	}
	</code></pre>
	
<p>That's all there is to it. Now we'll describe the details of the Cymbal syntax, grammar,
and semantics.</p><br/>

<a name="manual"></a>
<h2>Manual</h2><br/>
<a name="songs"></a>
<h3>Songs</h3>

<p>A <strong>Song</strong> is the main element of a Cymbal file. When executed, the code starts
when the Song block starts and ends when it ends. A file must have one and only one Song in order
to play. Think of it like a <code>main</code> function of a C file or a Java program. Songs must
also be given a name and a tempo in beats per minute (BPM). All names in Cymbal are surrounded 
by double quotes. The proper implementation of a Song block is:</p>

<pre>
<code>
	Song "MySong" 120{
		...
		...
		...
	}</code></pre>

<a name="phrases"></a>	
<h3>Phrases</h3>

<p>A <strong>Phrase</strong> is a kind of user-defined macro that can be declared before the
Song block starts. It can contain any code that the user might wish to reuse in several sections of
the Song. Cymbal allows for as many Phrases to be written as wanted (but it does not allow Phrases to
be written inside Phrases, or Songs.) A Phrase block might look like:</p>

<pre>
<code>
	Phrase "Bb Scale" {
		Quarter Bb3
		Quarter C3
		Quarter D3
		Quarter Eb3
		Quarter F3
		Quarter G3
		Quarter A4
		Quarter Bb
	}
		...
	Song "MySong" {
		...
	}
	</code></pre>
<p>To call a Phrase, simply write a the name of the Phrase like a subroutine call in the Song (or 
another Phrase.) Be sure to remember to use double quotes, even when you call a Phrase:</p>
<pre>
<code>
	Song "MySong" {
		"Bb Scale"()
	}</code></pre>
	
<a name="notes"></a>
<h3>Notes</h3>

<strong>Notes</strong> in Cymbal are expressed sequentially. Each Note requires two parts: the length
and the pitch. Notes can also be given an optional octave to be played in, following the pitch.</p>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lengths are: <code>Whole, Half, Quarter, Eighth</code><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pitches are: Ab-G#<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Octaves are: 1-8

<p>If a Note isn't given a specified octave (and it isn't within an Octave), it defaults to the octave
3. <strong>Rests</strong> can also be a kind of Note in Cymbal. Rests are declared with a length followed
by the keyword <code>Rest.</code></p>

<a name="comments"></a>
<h3>Comments</h3>

<p><strong>Comments</strong> in Cymbal are just like comments in C or Java. You can have 
both single line ( // ) comments or multi-line ( /* ...... */ ) comments.</p>
	
<a name="controlBlocks"></a>
<h3>Control Blocks</h3>

<p>The following control blocks - <strong>Octave, Volume,</strong> and <strong>Instrument,</strong>
are ways the user can encapsulate sets of Notes or Phrase calls to sound differently. Any of these blocks
can be used within Songs or Phrases and can be nested as many times as you want.</p>

<a name="octaves"></a>
<h3>Octaves</h3>

<p><strong>Octaves</strong> indicate that any Notes played within them will be played at the octave given.
You can also use '+' or '-' modifiers to change a specific note relative to its Octave block. (Note that you
cannot go below octave 1 and cannot go higher than octave 8).<br/>If you give a note a defined octave to play
in, it will override the Octave block.</p>

<pre>
<code>
	Octave 5 {
		Quarter C       // 5
		Quarter D       // 5
		Quarter E       // 5
		Quarter F2      // 2
		Quarter G3      // 3
		Quarter A+      // 6
	}
</code>
</pre>

<a name="volume"></a>
<h3>Volume</h3>

<p><strong>Volume</strong> blocks allow the user to specify one of five different volumes given by keywords. There
is a <code>default</code> value with a MIDI volume value of 75. The user can also define <code>piano, mesopiano, forte,</code> and <code>mesoforte.</code></p>

<pre>
<code>
	Volume piano {
		/**
		 * Everything in here plays
		 * in a piano volume
		 */
	}
</code>
</pre>

<a name="instruments"></a>
<h3>Instruments</h3>

<p><strong>Instrument</strong> blocks give all Notes and Phrases a specified MIDI instrument. There are a total
of 129 different instruments to choose from given in the table below. Note that some instruments naturally sound 
louder or quieter than others.</p>
